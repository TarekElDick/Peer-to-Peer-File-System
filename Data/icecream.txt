The random story that makes no sense starts off with an ice cream truck, a chef, and a piece of Pluto. The guys that owned the ice cream truck stole the piece of Pluto from the pastry chef who obtained it from the flying elephant. The flying elephant got it from a sumo wrestler who obtained it in the sumo championship on Saturn.
